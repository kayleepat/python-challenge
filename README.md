## Code Location
All code for this project is saved within the python-challenge directory. The python-challenge folder is broken up into two parts, pyBank and pyPoll, with all files for each project in their respective folder

## Help Recieved
All of the code in this project was completed by myself. I looked at extensive documentation to get the information required for several parts of this project. I looked at examples online to get information on how to include for loops within fstrings (for pyPollAnalysis.py), and include all of that into a variable. I also used chatgpt to help me debug. I made several simple typos in my code, and after I was unable to figure out why the code was not working I pasted it into chatgpt and the ai helped me locate the typos.
